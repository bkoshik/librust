# librust

Librust is a low-level Rust library that provides an errno handler and syscall utilities.

## Overview

This repository contains core components for interacting with system-level functionality in Rust, focusing on error handling and syscall abstractions. Librust is designed for developers building low-level or systems software in Rust who need direct access to OS features with robust error management.

## Features

- **Errno Handler:** Simplifies error handling from system calls.
- **Syscall Utilities:** Easy-to-use wrappers for system calls.
- **Rust Language:** Written entirely in Rust for safety and performance.

## Getting Started
